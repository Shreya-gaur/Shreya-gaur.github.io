<p>Welcome to my personal website, where I share my experiences and learnings from my project work as a Masters student at Purdue University. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from India, and I am now pursuing my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering, focusing on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, High Performance Computing, and Software Development. I have also worked for a year at Deloitte USI as an SAP Analyst and learned a great deal. This website is a platform where I will be discussing my coursework, projects, research and any other relevant experiences that I come across during my studies and my job.</p>

<p>I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences in these fields and I hope that through this website, I can provide valuable insights and resources to others who are also interested in these topics. So, whether you’re a fellow student, a researcher, or just someone who’s curious about these fields, I invite you to explore my website and join me on my journey of learning and discovery.</p>

<p>You can find more information about my credentials on this website. During my work and studies at SSN, I had the opportunity to work with the organisations mentioned on this page.</p>

  <p>
    My time at DA-IICT involved me learning the basics of arduino use. Later during the internship I developed a lot of interest in the field of Image Processing and Machine Learning. I also had the idea of developing a machine learning model to classify indian paintings into the region that they origin from using ML. The lack of dataset available however proved to be a great obstacle for the study.

  <p>
    I was selected as an Indian National Science Academy Fellow in the year of 2020. I got the opportunity to work with Dr. Sheetal Kalyani and her phD student Nancy Nayak on the study of deep double descent in Convolutional Neural Networks.

  <p>
    I underwent a remote internship with Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. The internship was an introductory program to machine learning. We were guided by Dr. Raj Reddy from the CS department. The culmination of the internship included us working on the creation of Autism Diagnosis tool using the responses of DSM 5 Manual with the help of Machine Learning.
