<p>Hey there! My name is Shreya Gaur and I am currently a student at Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana. I am doing my masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Before coming to Purdue, I got my Bachelorâ€™s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, Tamil Nadu, India and then worked for an year in Deloitte USI. You can find more information about my credentials on this website. During my career and studies at SSN, I had the opportunity to work with the organisations mentioned on this page. I worked on independent projects in each of these places and learned a lot.</p>

<p>In the Blogs Section, I elaborate on my work and studies at SSN and Purdue University. I share the knowledge that I have gained in hopes that someone may find it useful.</p>

  <summary markdown="span">Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gujrat, India</summary>
  <p>
    My time at DA-IICT involved me learning the basics of arduino use. Later during the internship I developed a lot of interest in the field of Image Processing and Machine Learning. I also had the idea of developing a machine learning model to classify indian paintings into the region that they origin from using ML. The lack of dataset available however proved to be a great obstacle for the study.

  <p>
    I was selected as an Indian National Science Academy Fellow in the year of 2020. I got the opportunity to work with Dr. Sheetal Kalyani and her phD student Nancy Nayak on the study of deep double descent in Convolutional Neural Networks.

  <summary markdown="span">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA</summary>
  <p>
    I underwent a remote internship with Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. The internship was an introductory program to machine learning. We were guided by Dr. Raj Reddy from the CS department. The culmination of the internship included us working on the creation of Autism Diagnosis tool using the responses of DSM 5 Manual with the help of Machine Learning.
