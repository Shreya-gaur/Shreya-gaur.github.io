Hey there! My name is Shreya Gaur and I am currently a student at Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana. I am doing my masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Before coming to Purdue, I got my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, Tamil Nadu, India and then worked for an year in Deloitte USI. 

You are currently viewing my website. I elaborate on my work and studies at university here and share my the knowledge that I have gained, in hopes that someone may find it useful. You can also find more information about my credentials here.

During my career and studies at SSN, I had the opportunity to work with the following organisations. I worked on independent projects in each of these places and learned a lot.

<p>
    My time at DA-IICT involved me learning the basics of arduino use. Later during the internship I developed a lot of interest in the field of Image Processing and Machine Learning. I also had the idea of developing a machine learning model to classify indian paintings into the region that they origin from using ML. The lack of dataset available however proved to be a great obstacle for the study.

#### 2020
<details><summary markdown="span">Indian Institute of Technology - Madras, Chennai, India</summary>
<p>
    I was selected as an Indian National Science Academy Fellow in the year of 2020. I got the opportunity to work with Dr. Sheetal Kalyani and her phD student Nancy Nayak on the study of deep double descent in Convolutional Neural Networks.

<p>
    I underwent a remote internship with Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. The internship was an introductory program to machine learning. We were guided by Dr. Raj Reddy from the CS department. The culmination of the internship included us working on the creation of Autism Diagnosis tool using the responses of DSM 5 Manual with the help of Machine Learning.

#### 2021
<details><summary markdown="span">University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany</summary>
<p>
    For my final year project I work with Dr. Wolfgang Gerstacker on Modulation classification system for Power-factor Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Signals using ResNets. The study yielded great results and is yet to get published.

<details><summary markdown="span">Deloitte US Offices of India, Hyderabad, India</summary>
<p>
    My first job was with the Partner Accounting and Reporting team of Enabling Areas in Deloitte USI. My work pertained to the use of SAP Advanced Business Application Programming language. During my year at deloitte I worked on the creation of Employment Verification forms using SAP Adobe Forms and ABAP.
