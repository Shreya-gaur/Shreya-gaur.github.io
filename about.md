  Hey there! My name is Shreya and I am currently a Master's student at Purdue University, West Lafayette. You are currently viewing my blog.
</p>

I created this blog in order to reaffirm what I learn in class and catalogue all the cool things I learned to do. 

You can find two things in this blog:

* Information about my work and projects
* Contents of what I learn at the university

You can find me at:
* [Github](https://github.com/Shreya-gaur)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreya-gaur22599/)
